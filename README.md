# WEB SCRAPING - STOCK - PRICES


# Repository Context 📜

* With the explosion of data in recent decades, we constantly have to access data in our areas of expertise and perform analysis. With my work experience, many times my manager asks me to collect some specific data or series of data from a website.

* I remember that many times these routines took a long time to be carried out and sometimes these routines were done manually.

* For this reason, to help solve this type of problem, I decided to demonstrate, through the R programming language, a process of collecting data from a specific site.

# Web Scraping context 💻 🌐

* Web scraping is the process of using automation mechanisms to extract content and data from a website.

* Web scraping extracts the underlying HTML code and with it data is stored in a database.

# Area chosen for data collection application 💻 📈 📉

* I decided to apply this concept of Web Scraping in the financial area, as one of the main reasons for choosing this area is due to the fact that I had worked for two years in a market intelligence area, where it was necessary to collect data on the main price values of the Brazilian electricity sector.

* As a reminder of some data collection techniques I learned from my experience, I decided to apply these data collection concepts to the Yahoo Finance website.
